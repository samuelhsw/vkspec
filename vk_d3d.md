# Vulkan / D3D Specifications
As a contributor to the Vulkan specification, it was a nightmare when I first looked at both specifications to figure out the "delta" based on my knowledge of GPU architecture/driver/compiler and what I've been educated by the developers. If you feel the same pain and then I hope this document might be a cure.
